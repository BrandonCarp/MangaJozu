Cache Validation
All requests return a ETag header which is an MD5 hash of the response
You can use this hash to verify if there's new or updated content by suppliying it as the value for the If-None-Match in your next request header
You will get a HTTP 304 - Not Modified response if the content has not changed
If the content has changed, you'll get a HTTP 200 - OK response with the updated JSON response
